# RNN_Text_Gen
## Implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using Pytorch
## Downstream application: Text Generation

### DataFromReuters.ipynb:

This is the notebook file to create and save Reuters documents in the data folder.

### RNN_SLM.ipynb:

This file contains the recurrent neural network.

**Remarks:**
Make sure to install Pytorch on your computer. Having an Nvidia GPU will help. I am assuming that all the packages are in place.

In the videos, I used Jupyter Notebook.

Here are three three videos that explains the code and the theory:
