# RNN_Text_Gen
## Implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using Pytorch
## Downstream application: Text Generation

Here are three videos that explain the theory and the code:

**Part 1: Theory of RNN: An Easy Tutorial**

# Jupyter Notebook Files:
### DataFromReuters.ipynb:

This is the notebook file to create and save Reuters documents in the data folder.

### RNN_SLM.ipynb:

This file contains the recurrent neural network and the functions to generate text.

**Remarks:**
Make sure to install Pytorch on your computer. Having an Nvidia GPU will help. I am assuming that all the packages are in place.
